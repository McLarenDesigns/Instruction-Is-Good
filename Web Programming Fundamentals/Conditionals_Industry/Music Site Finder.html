// This line does a number of things. First it creates the variable age. Then it makes the prompt window pop up and I specified that it should say, "We will redirect you to the appropriate site. Our system is based on if you are older or younger than sixty. How old are you?". I also specified that the field should be have a zero in it when the user sees it. I did that with the zero between my two quotation marks at the end.

// What this translates to is if the age is less than sixty, write on the page "Please enjoy yourself!! ;)" followed by a line break. Then it says redirect the page to "http://www.universalstudios.com/" . Then it says to write on the page "You will be redirected to a suitable page in 8 seconds." and I set the timer for 8000. When you use the timer you write the number of seconds multiplied by 1000 as your timer.
