do {

        var myMusic= prompt("Do you like Rock(1), Rnb(2), Rap(3), or Country(4)? Enter the number you see next to your style of music.", "");

// This line does a number of things. First it creates the variable "myMusic". Then it makes the prompt window pop up and I specified that it should say, "Do you like Rock(1), Rnb(2), Rap(3), or Country(4). Enter the number you see next to your style of music." I initially tried to have javascript react to the words themselves being submitted but I was a bit rusty. I also specified that the field should be have nothing in it when the user sees it. I did that by putting nothing between my two quotation marks at the end.
  } while ((myMusic < 1 && myMusic != null) || (myMusic > 4 && myMusic != null))

// This here is the end of my " 'do' 'while' loop" which specifies that as the loop should continue as long as the number entered into the field is less than 1 and the user does not click cancel



// The key to the User input numbers is as follows: "Rock" = 1 "Rnb" = 2 "Rap" = 3 "Country" = 4 

if (myMusic == 4)	
 
 {
		document.write("Enjoy Country <br />");
	
function Redirect()
{
    window.location="http://www.cmt.com/music/radio";
}

document.write("You will be redirected to a suitable page in 5 seconds. <br/>");
setTimeout('Redirect()', 2000);
}

// What this translates to is if the myMusic is equal to four, write on the page "Enjoy Country" followed by a line break. Then it says redirect the page to "www.cmt.com/music/radio" . Then it says to write on the page "You will be redirected to a suitable page in 5 seconds." and I set the timer for 2000. When you use the timer you write the number of seconds multiplied by 1000 as your timer. However, why not cause a little happiness in the world? I tell them wait 5 seconds. They get what they want in two. They'll always be happy to see me.

document.write("You will be redirected to a suitable page in 5 seconds.");
setTimeout('Redirect()', 2000);
}

// Here we have basically the same code. I'm just redirecting them to rnb music.


if (myMusic == 3)

    window.location="http://www.last.fm/tag/rap";

//redirecting them to rap
