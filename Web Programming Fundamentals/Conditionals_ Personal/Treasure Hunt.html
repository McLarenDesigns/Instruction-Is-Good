        var myProject= prompt("What was the name of my second project?", "");

// This line does a number of things. First it creates the variable "myMusic". Then it makes the prompt window pop up and I specified that it should say, "Do you like Rock(1), Rnb(2), Rap(3), or Country(4). Enter the number you see next to your style of music." I initially tried to have javascript react to the words themselves being submitted but I was a bit rusty. I also specified that the field should be have nothing in it when the user sees it. I did that by putting nothing between my two quotation marks at the end.
  } while (myProject != "Music Site Finder" && myProject != null)

// This here is the end of my " 'do' 'while' loop" which specifies that as the loop should continue as long as the number entered into the field is less than 1 and the user does not click cancel



// The key to the User input numbers is as follows: "Rock" = 1 "Rnb" = 2 "Rap" = 3 "Country" = 4 

if (myProject == "Music Site Finder")	
 
 {
		document.write("You will be redirected closer to your goal in 23 seconds... <br /> You will have exactly that long to memorize these instructions.<br /> <br />Step one has already been done for you. <br /> <br />Step 2: Copy and paste the site's code into your own text editor. </br /> <br /> Step 3: Save the file as 'Good listening.html' <br /> <br /> Step 4: Run the file in your internet browser. <br /> <br /> Step 5: Answer the prompt and enjoy your prize!!!

}

setTimeout('Redirect()', 23000);
}

// What this translates to is if the myMusic is equal to four, write on the page "Enjoy Country" followed by a line break. Then it says redirect the page to "www.cmt.com/music/radio" . Then it says to write on the page "You will be redirected to a suitable page in 5 seconds." and I set the timer for 2000. When you use the timer you write the number of seconds multiplied by 1000 as your timer. However, why not cause a little happiness in the world? I tell them wait 5 seconds. They get what they want in two. They'll always be happy to see me.
