// If you can answer this question you get a set of instructions that will take you to a prize.
        var myProject = prompt("What was the name of my second project?.", "");

// This line does a number of things. First it creates the variable "myMusic". Then it makes the prompt window pop up and I specified that it should say, "Do you like Rock(1), Rnb(2), Rap(3), or Country(4). Enter the number you see next to your style of music." I initially tried to have javascript react to the words themselves being submitted but I was a bit rusty. I also specified that the field should be have nothing in it when the user sees it. I did that by putting nothing between my two quotation marks at the end.
 

// This here is the end of my " 'do' 'while' loop" which specifies that as the loop should continue as long as the number entered into the field is less than 1 and the user does not click cancel



// The key to the User input numbers is as follows: "Rock" = 1 "Rnb" = 2 "Rap" = 3 "Country" = 4 

if (myProject == Music Site Finder)	
 
 {
		document.write(" Now that you have found the name for my second project. You must locate it and run it in your browser.
Step 1: When this page redirects you to Github.com, you must find the word "Committed". Click on it. <br /> <br /> <br > <br /> <br />






Step 2: On the vey last Commit, look for the words "View file" CLick on it. <br /> <br /> <br > <br /> <br />







Step 3: Look at the top of the file where it says either "Raw" or "View raw" and respectively download it and run it or copy and paste it
 into your own text editor where you can save it as an html file and run it through your browser <br /> <br /> <br > <br /> <br />







Step 4:


		 Enjoy your prize. Free Music!<br />");
	
function Redirect()
{
    window.location="https://github.com/McLarenDesigns/Instruction-Is-Good/commits/master";
}

document.write("You will be redirected closer to your goal in 18 seconds. <br/>");
setTimeout('Redirect()', 18000);
}

// What this translates to is if the myMusic is equal to four, write on the page "Enjoy Country" followed by a line break. Then it says redirect the page to "www.cmt.com/music/radio" . Then it says to write on the page "You will be redirected to a suitable page in 5 seconds." and I set the timer for 2000. When you use the timer you write the number of seconds multiplied by 1000 as your timer. However, why not cause a little happiness in the world? I tell them wait 5 seconds. They get what they want in two. They'll always be happy to see me.
